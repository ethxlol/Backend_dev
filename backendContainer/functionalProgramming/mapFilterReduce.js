  Reduce

The reduce method iterates over the functionsArray and applies each function to the accumulated value.
Starting with an initial value of 10, it applies the functions in sequence:

1. triple: 10 * 3 = 30
2. addFour: 30 + 4 = 34
3. subtractThree: 34 - 3 = 31
4. double: 31 * 2 = 62
5. Math.sqrt: Square root of 62 â‰ˆ 7.874007874011811

The final result is approximately 7.87, which is displayed using the toFixed method with 2 decimal places.
