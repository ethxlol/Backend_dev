to check globally anything in npm
npm outdated -g (this will check on a global scale for outdated packages)

to install stuff 
npm install (-g if you want it globally)
and for dev we need npm install something --save-dev at the end

to make a init file package.json
npm init

to update an old dependency 
npm update next (this will update next)

the above almost never works though so we use this instead
npm install next (this will reinstall locally, we can do -g if we want it globally)

to uninstall
npm uninstall

to audit something that has vulnerabilities upon installing
npm audit 

There might be  a fix if so:
npm audit fix

if not we simply npm uninstall

what we also can do if we need a package maybe only once for a project:
npx -p @angular/cli ng new myapp 

in our package.json we can add to our scripts something we would like to be able to install with a run <i class=""scripts": {
		"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
		"createMoo": "npx cowsay hello!" <<<<<< This is the one that we added
	}, fa-comment-alt-dollar    "></i>
  So now we can do npm run createMoo, and the cowsay will run
